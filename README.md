# BioHack Academy Documentation Site

This is a simplified template for your own, public BioHack Academy Documentation Site.

_Github Pages_ are websites that are written in Markdown and hosted on github.com. GitHub Pages are based on the Jekyll, a powerful and sometimes complex Static Site Generatator (SSG). This repository tries to make it a little bit simpler an accessible.



## 1. Fork this Repository
Fork this repo, by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of this page.

## 2. Rename the repository 
Next, go to the _Settings_ tab, and rename the repository to something you like - maybe something descriptive, let's say: `biohack`
The URL of your website will be: `<yourgithubusername>.github.io/biohack`

## 3. Set up Github Pages
Go to the _Settings_ tab, then click on the _Pages_ Submenu on the left. Select your _main_ branch as the source, and click `Save`. The _root_ folder is fine for now, you can change it later. After saving, you get a message saying that your site is ready.

## 4. Choose a Theme
Github Pages let you choose an internal theme, but we want to use our BioHack Theme, we need to tell Github Pages about that.


## 3. Customize and view your site

Configure your site name, description and url by editing the _config.yml file. 

You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with Jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon

> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:

> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).
> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.
> 3. RECOMMENDED: Clone down your repository to your harddrive and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository, using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Here's a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdhuWDdu-rk).
  
### Step 4) Publish your first blog post

Edit `/_posts/2016-2-23-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just click on **Create new file** in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md (just like **2016-2-23-Hello-World.md** ). Note that posts with a date in the future will not show.

### Step 5) Change the About Pages

Edit `/about.md` to change the information on the About page of your documentation site.

## Moar!

There is a more detailed walkthrough, [**Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages**](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) over at the Smashing Magazine website. Check it out if you'd like a more detailed walkthrough and some background on Jekyll. 

It covers:
